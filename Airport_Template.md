#  What are they?
In this section you should explain what actually goes in the file - use your discretion as to how far you explain this, as it may be more or less obvious based on context. 
If the need for them is not obvious, it may also be worth explaining why they go into the sector file.
# What do they look like in EuroScope?
This is mostly for display related items, but a screenshot should be included of how they display in ES (you may wish to explicitly state what actually in the screenshot is in the file) and also how to turn their display on and off.

To add screenshots, you can copy a screenshot from LightShot or similar, paste it into a GitHub issue, then copy the resulting URL and add it in using the format (without the spaces):

> ! [] (url)

# How to format them
State what file they go into, then give a generic format of how they should be display - use square brackets [] to indicate what is replaceable.
Using the code indent makes this look nice. You should also provide an example, preferably from the screenshot above, and a link to further examples.
if they contain generic ES formatting points, such as for colours or for coordinates, this should be mentioned but not explained - docs will be coming out relating to these that can then just be linked to.
# Where to find them?
If they are gathered under a particular label that may assist a user in finding them, this should be placed in here.
# Reference
A link to the relevant page on the VRC wiki (.SCT stuff) or ES wiki (.ese stuff) should be included for completeness. However, users shouldn't regularly need to use these - it should be explained fully on this page.
